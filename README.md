# star_rating

12 October 2017

Please, take a look at CANVAS.html and my other lines of code.  I'm attempting to create a star rating modal for my porject site, 
but it's kicking my butt.  The jQuery works to push a rating number.  You can see it in the console.  But, the changing of star color
doesn't stick with the click, and it's going backwards...

AKA, I need help.
